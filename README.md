# 🎲 Dolanan Matematika

**Dolanan Matematika** (Math Play) is a collection of two-player math strategy board games designed for **elementary school kids (6–12 years old)**, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two games are currently available:

- **Rumah Penjumlahan** (Addition House) — manipulate shared addition pions to control which cells you can claim.
- **Rumah Perkalian** (Multiplication House) — manipulate shared multiplication pions using products instead of sums.

Both games challenge players to align **4 consecutive pions** on a 10×10 board through strategic pion movement.

## How to Play

### Home Screen

Launch the app to see the **game selection hub**. Pick a game tile to begin — **Rumah Penjumlahan** (Addition House) or **Rumah Perkalian** (Multiplication House). Each game has its own setup, coin toss, placement, and game screens.

### Game Setup

1. Enter **Player 1's name** (Blue pion).
2. Choose a game mode:
   - **👥 PvP Lokal** — Two human players on the same device.
   - **🤖 vs AI** — Play against the computer.
3. If you choose **vs AI**, select the AI level:
  - **Easy** — more forgiving and less consistent.
  - **Normal** — balanced tactical AI.
  - **Hard** — stronger tactical AI with limited lookahead.
4. Select a **turn timer** (15s, 30s, 60s, or unlimited).
5. If PvP, enter **Player 2's name** (Red pion).
6. Click **"Mulai Permainan"** (Start Game).

After each round, use **"Rematch"** to start again with the same settings (mode, timer, and AI difficulty).

### Coin Toss

- Player 1 picks a side: **Kepala** (Head) or **Ekor** (Tail).
- An animated coin flip determines the winner.
- The coin toss winner gets to **place both pions** on the Addition Board and takes the **first turn**.

### Initial Placement

- The coin toss winner places **two pions** on the side board:
  - **Rumah Penjumlahan**: Addition Board (2×10 grid, values 1–10). Some columns may be disabled for the second pion if the sum would exceed 18.
  - **Rumah Perkalian**: Multiplication Board (2×9 grid, values 1–9). No column restrictions — all products are valid.
  - **First pion**: Can be placed on either Row 1 (Blue) or Row 2 (Red).
  - **Second pion**: Must be placed on the remaining row.
- After both pions are placed, click **"Konfirmasi Penempatan"** to begin.

### Gameplay Loop

Each turn consists of **two phases**:

1. **Move Pion** — The active player moves their pion to a **different column** on their row of the side board. The two pion values are combined (summed for Addition, multiplied for Multiplication).
2. **Place on Board** — The player claims an **unclaimed cell** on the 10×10 Game Board whose value matches the current result. Matching cells are highlighted in gold.

Play alternates between players after each complete turn.

During play, the main 10×10 board shows **edge coordinates** from `a1` to `j10`, and the move tracker records each completed turn in a compact notation such as `4 5 = 9 b8`.

### Winning the Game

The first player to get **4 of their pions in a row** on the 10×10 Game Board wins. Winning lines can be:

- ↔️ Horizontal
- ↕️ Vertical
- ↗️ Diagonal (either direction)

Winning cells glow green to celebrate the victory.

After the win overlay appears, players can use the **close button** to dismiss it and review the final board state plus the full move history.

## Game Mechanics

### Rumah Penjumlahan (Addition)

| Board | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Game Board** | 10×10 | Each cell has a random value between **2 and 18**. At game start, every valid value from 2 to 18 is guaranteed to appear at least once on the board. Players claim cells by matching the current sum. |
| **Addition Board** | 2×10 | Two rows of values **1–10**. Row 1 = Player 1 (Blue), Row 2 = Player 2 (Red). Each row has one pion. |

**Sum Calculation:**

```
Sum = (Player 1's pion value) + (Player 2's pion value)
```

- Pion values range from **1 to 10**, so possible sums are **2–20** (capped at 18 via disabled columns).
- A player **must move** to a different column. Columns where the sum would exceed 18 are **disabled**.

**Example:** Player 1's pion on column 5 + Player 2's pion on column 7 = sum **12**. Claim a cell with value 12.

### Rumah Perkalian (Multiplication)

| Board | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Game Board** | 10×10 | Each cell has a random value from the set of **valid products** of two numbers 1–9. At game start, all 36 valid products (1, 2, 3, ..., 72, 81) are guaranteed to appear at least once on the board. |
| **Multiplication Board** | 2×9 | Two rows of values **1–9**. Row 1 = Player 1 (Blue), Row 2 = Player 2 (Red). Each row has one pion. |

**Product Calculation:**

```
Product = (Player 1's pion value) × (Player 2's pion value)
```

- Pion values range from **1 to 9**, so possible products are **1–81**.
- All products are valid — no columns are disabled by value range. Only the current position is disabled (must move).

**Example:** Player 1's pion on column 3 × Player 2's pion on column 7 = product **21**. Claim a cell with value 21.

**Valid Products (36 unique values):**
`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 32, 35, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48, 49, 54, 56, 63, 64, 72, 81`

### First Turn Special Rule

On the **very first turn** (belonging to the coin toss winner), the player may move **either** pion (Blue or Red) — not just their own. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the opening move. After the first turn, each player can only move their own pion. This rule applies to both games.

### Auto Game Over

A player **automatically loses** in the following situations:

1. **Time runs out** — If the turn timer expires, the current player loses immediately. No partial effort is counted.
2. **Dead-end move** — If the current result (sum or product) has no available (unclaimed) cells on the Game Board, and the player had an alternative pion position that would yield available cells → **Auto-lose** (the opponent wins).
3. **Draw** — If no valid pion position exists with available cells for the current player → the game ends in a **Draw**.

This prevents stalling tactics and deliberately choosing dead-end positions.

### Turn Timer

Each turn can be time-limited. Players select a timer duration before the game starts:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **15 detik** | 15 seconds per turn |
| **30 detik** | 30 seconds per turn (default) |
| **60 detik** | 60 seconds per turn |
| **∞ Tanpa Batas** | No time limit |

When the timer runs out, the current player **automatically loses** — no partial effort is counted. The opponent wins immediately.

## AI Opponent

The AI (always Player 2 / Red) now supports **three difficulty levels** in both games:

- **Easy**: uses lighter tactical weights and higher randomness so it makes more mistakes.
- **Normal**: uses strong heuristic evaluation (win/block/streak/center), similar to the previous AI behavior.
- **Hard**: uses the same tactical heuristic plus a **limited depth-2 lookahead** (candidate filtering + opponent best response check) to avoid obvious traps.

Core priorities remain the same across levels:

1. Take immediate wins.
2. Block immediate opponent wins.
3. Build own streaks and disrupt opponent streaks.
4. Prefer center control when tactical value is close.

For **initial placement** and the first board placement after coin toss, the same difficulty profile is applied so behavior stays consistent from opening to mid-game.

## AI Implementation Docs

Recommended structure:

- Keep **README** focused on product-level summary (difficulty tiers, high-level AI priorities).
- Put full technical details in a dedicated document: **[`docs/AI-IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/AI-IMPLEMENTATION.md)**.

The dedicated AI document is the right place for:

- architecture differences between `AI` (Addition) and `AIMult` (Multiplication),
- move scoring weights and tie-break order,
- opening/placement strategy per difficulty,
- lookahead flow for Hard mode,
- extension guidelines for future AI tuning.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Semantic markup (`<main>`, ARIA attributes), single-page structure
- **CSS3** — Custom properties, CSS Grid, Flexbox, keyframe animations, `100dvh` viewport, responsive media queries (600px, 400px breakpoints + landscape)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — ES6+ strict mode, IIFE module pattern, Web Audio API for sound effects, `localStorage` for persistence
- **Zero Dependencies** — No frameworks, no build tools, no external assets

### Module Responsibilities

Each game has its own set of three modules that follow the same architecture:

| Module | Penjumlahan | Perkalian | Role |
|--------|------------|-----------|------|
| **Game Logic** | `Game` | `GameMult` | Board generation, move validation, win detection, turn management |
| **AI** | `AI` | `AIMult` | Heuristic move evaluation, initial placement strategy |
| **UI** | `UI` | `UIMult` | DOM rendering, screen transitions, event handling, timer |
| **Sound** | `SFX` (shared) | `SFX` (shared) | Web Audio API tone generation, mute toggle, localStorage persistence |

The games are fully independent — separate files, separate state, separate screens. The home screen, win/draw overlays, how-to-play modal, sound system, and floating buttons are shared. This architecture ensures changes to one game never break the other.

## Getting Started

No build step required. Just serve the files with any static HTTP server:

```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Using Node.js (npx)
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8080
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Alternatively, simply open `index.html` directly in a modern browser.
